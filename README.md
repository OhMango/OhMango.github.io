# Playable Ads Practice

What are playable Ads ?

Playable ads work as a “try before you buy” type ad unit, letting users interact with an app’s main features before installing it. It’s an ad that doesn’t feel like an ad.

Why playable ads?

HTML5 interactive ads are great for immersing your audience and reducing churn rates
